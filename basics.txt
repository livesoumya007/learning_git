Three main states in git
>> modified -> locally changed 
>> stage -> 
>> commited

git commands
=====================
>> $ git config --list --show-origin => it will show all the configs user level and system level

here if u want to use some other mail. it will be in the project level
>> git config --local user.email=dearsrp007@gmail.com

again if you want to unset the project level
>> git config --unset user.email

to get all the commits
>> git log

to get the difference between the changes made in the file
>>git diff => diff between working and staging
>> git diff --staged => diff between staged and repo
>> git diff head  => diff between working and repo

to change a file name and u don't need to put again in the staging area like nothing will change 
automatically it will rename 
>> git mv nameA nameB

to remove from staging area
>> git restore --staged <fileName>

create a new branch
>> git branch <new_branch_name>

create a new branch and checkout
>> git checkout -b newBranch

show all the branches
>> git branch 

rename a git branch
it will rename the current branch that u r in 
>> git branch -m new_branch

delete a branch
before deleting the branch u need to checkout to some other branch
>> git branch -d new_branch


how to merge two branches
==============================
you can check merging 2 branches word doc for reference

We can abort the merge also by git merge â€“abort

GIT Rebase
=================
>> Rebase is one of the powerful command in git
>> rebasing is often used as an alternative to merging
>> rebasing a branch updates one branch with another by applying the 
   commits of one branch on top of the commits of another branch

interactive rebasing
=======================
lets say there is a feature branch
>> and we have commited 3 or 4 times
>> well at the end we need to add this to the master right
>> and I don't want to show those 4 commits 
>> i want to show only 1 commit 
>> 

command to interactive rebasing
>> git rebase -i master(coomit id first wala kuch git log se lena matlab yaha pe jo master likha ha kis k sath rebase karna ha wo wala) 
then it will open an editor and there we can edit the commits like remove the unnecessary ones 
and will add a final commit message there 

modify or change the latest commit using amend command
>>
